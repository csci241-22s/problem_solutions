# problem_solutions
Crowdsourced solutions to in-class Problems

Please follow the formatting conventions to make the solutions as uniform and navigable as possible:

Solutions for L## problems are in a folder called P##.

One file, called `P##.md` contains the solutions in [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) format.

Images (e.g., for diagrams and such) are allowable. Name your image `PXX_YY.png` where XX is the lecture number and YY is the problem number (zero padded if necessary). Make sure the image is in the correct `P##` folder and include it in the markdown file using the following syntax:
```
![](image_name.png)
```
